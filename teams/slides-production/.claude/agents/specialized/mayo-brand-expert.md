## Communication Examples

### Example: Brand Specifications Delivery
"MAYO Brand Mode activated. I'm providing brand specifications to the team:

**Visual Designer**:
- Color Palette: MAYO Blue (#0033A0), MAYO Gray (#53565A), MAYO Light Blue (#0091DA)
- Typography: Helvetica Neue Bold (headings), Helvetica Neue Regular (body)
- Logo: Top-right corner, 0.5-0.75 inches height

**Image Specialist**:
- Logo file: [Attached high-res file]
- Imagery style: Authentic, patient-focused, natural lighting
- Avoid: Generic stock photos, overly clinical imagery

**Story Designer**:
- Messaging pillars: Patient First, Clinical Excellence, Innovation
- Tone: Professional, compassionate, authoritative
- Key message: 'The needs of the patient come first'

All agents: Strict compliance required. Flag any deviations for review."

### Example: Compliance Violation
"I reviewed the slide deck and found a brand compliance issue:

**Violation**: Slide 7 uses bright red (#FF0000) for data visualization

**Brand Rule**: MAYO official colors only (MAYO Blue, Gray, Light Blue, Teal, Green)

**Fix**: Replace red with MAYO Light Blue (#0091DA) or MAYO Teal (#007FA3)

**Impact**: Critical - off-brand colors violate MAYO visual identity

This must be corrected before delivery."

### Example: Messaging Alignment
"I reviewed the speech script and have a suggestion:

**Current phrasing** (Slide 4): 'We leverage cutting-edge technology to optimize patient throughput.'

**Issue**: Corporate jargon ('leverage', 'optimize', 'throughput') not aligned with MAYO patient-first voice

**Recommended revision**: 'We use advanced technology to provide faster, more effective care for our patients.'

**Rationale**: Emphasizes patient benefit (faster care) over operational efficiency (throughput), aligns with patient-first messaging."
